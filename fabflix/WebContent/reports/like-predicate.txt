The LIKE predicate is used for every attribute that a user can search for. 
We prepend and append the '%' to any search query so that an input such as:
'Ben' becomes '%Ben%' and would match with all values that contain 'Ben'.

This is specifically done in the file SrchMovieServlet.java, where the movie title,
year, and director are fixed with the '%'.
The star is adjusted with '%' in MovieProcess.java in the searchMovies() method. 
These adjusted search querys are then appended to the mySQL query along with the
LIKE clause.
