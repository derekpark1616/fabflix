<title>Optimization Technique for XML Parsing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We used caching as the first technique where we loaded the list of stars and movies and saved them in a list array (loadMivies, loadMovies2 and loadStars methods are for this...). <br>This for checking against the existence of a record before updating the tables<br>
Here also with intelligently avoid making too much database connection request. <br>We open the database connection at the start of the parsing for all 3 xml file and close the connection at the end... This is cool <br>
</p>
<p> The second technique combined the use of caching and preparedstatment. This Reduces parsing time as the preparation on <br>the query is done only once (even if the statement is executed multiple times)<br>
<br>Only the changed parameters are sent back to the server, not the whole query, thus reducing the bandwidth usage<br>Another benefit is Security...It Prevents SQL injections, <br>because the original SQL statement is not derived from external input.<br>
 
With this technique, parsing process for all 3 files only took 4 minutes.</p>
